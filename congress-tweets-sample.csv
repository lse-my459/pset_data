The #GOPShutdown means we rely more on foreign energy as the issuance of permits for energy production on federal lands stop. National Institute of Health researches medical cures for life-threatening illnesses, #GOPShutdown means life-saving research is stops. House R's have America on course for #GOPShutdown. Tomorrow, hundreds of thousands of Fed employees face furloughs &amp; many will work w/o pay. RT if you agree.

And the defining project of our generation is to restore that promise. #SOTU http://t.co/4uTnPiRJgY We also have the chance, right now, to beat other countries in the race for the next wave of high-tech manufacturing jobs. #SOTU Let’s do more to help the entrepreneurs and small business owners who create most new jobs in America #SOTU China and Europe aren’t standing on the sidelines.  Neither should we. #SOTU Today America is closer to energy independence than we’ve been in decades. #SOTU Taken together, our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner, safer planet. #SOTU In this rapidly-changing economy, we have to make sure that every American has the skills to fill those jobs. #SOTU First, this Congress needs to restore the unemployment insurance you just let expire for 1.6 million people. #SOTU We are stronger when America fields a full team. #SOTU The problem is we’re still not reaching enough kids, and we’re not reaching them in time.  That has to change #SOTU Let's all come together: Congress, the WH, &amp; business from Wall Street to Main Street; give every woman the opportunity she deserves #SOTU Because if you cook our troops’ meals or wash their dishes, you shouldn’t have to live in poverty. #SOTU So join the rest of the country.  Say yes.  Give America a raise. #SOTU That’s what health insurance reform is all about – the peace of mind that if misfortune strikes, you don’t have to lose everything. #SOTU Citizenship means standing up for everyone’s right to vote #SOTU It should be the power of our vote, not the size of our bank account, that drives our democracy. #SOTU Together with our allies, we will complete our mission there by the end of this year, &amp; America’s longest war will finally be over. #SOTU Let’s remember that our leadership is defined not just by our defense against threats, but by the enormous opportunities to do good #SOTU Our freedom, our democracy, has never been easy.  Sometimes we stumble; we make mistakes; we get frustrated or discouraged. #SOTU But for more than two hundred years, we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress #SOTU If we summon what is best in us, with our feet planted firmly in today but our eyes cast towards tomorrow; I know it’s within reach #SOTU RT @rollcall: Live now on @rollcall.com: @RepTerriSewell with @cbellantoni Statement from Congresswoman Terri A.

Davis-Bacon protects workers by preventing wage exploitation while still ensuring that the value &amp; work quality are not compromised. Without Davis-Bacon protection, unscrupulous contractors will be free to exploit tradesmen/women who face high levels of unemployment. Generations of trades workers, by the sweat of their brows and the toil of their hands, built our great Nation. They deserve our respect. Yesterday, the House approved an amendment sponsored by Rep.
